I started this project with a couple things in mind
1) To educate aspiring coders about basic security and vulnerabilities with code, game dev or exploiter
   
  1a.) To show game devs how easy it is to edit and overall just violate anything you put in a localscript, and no it does not change anything if you delete the script, we can just getgc() that shit
   
  1b.) To show exploiters, in depth how to code hooks, garbage collection, and the likes, to bypass anticheats
   
  1c.) To show some hopefully unique methods of coding, and to inspire people to just be original in their coding and make their own standard
   
  1d.) To make a resource to act as possibly a guide for people, due to the things I personally found annoying or hard, and proper use cases for code
  
 2) A personal project to get better at making my code readable, understandable, and overall good
    
  2a.) I will not however do the following things: Untrunacate variables unless I believe there is a need to (typically one letter or 2-4), for intuitive coding to be seen, DEFINE VARIABLES THAT I DO NOT NEED, and I will NEVER use camelcase.
  
3) to NEVER profit off of this, and to NEVER gatekeep
   
  3a.) I will NEVER create a key system
  
  3b.) I will NEVER create a paid subscription
  
  3c.) I won't even ask to credit me
    
    3c.I) just don't profit off of my work, I will copyright this, and I will claim your content
  
  3d.) I will not make any special scripts, the scripts I will release will be for EVERYONE
    
    3d.I) if you wanna beat other exploiters or wtv then make your own script
